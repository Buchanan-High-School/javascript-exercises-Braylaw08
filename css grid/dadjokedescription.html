        <p class="main">This generator gives you some funny dad jokes that you may or may not like. This project was made using java script, css, and html. The html has all of the words, buttons, and fourms. The css was used to color the background and add shadows to each box. The java script was used to make the buttons work. It was also used to get the information from another site and display it. It also allows you to rate the jokes and comment on them before you save the joke.</p>
