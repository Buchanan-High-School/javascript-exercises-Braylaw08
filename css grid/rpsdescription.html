        <p class="main">This game allows you to play against a bot to see if you are smarter than the bot. This project was made using java script, css, and html. The html has all of the words and the picture in it. It also holds the buttons. The css was used to adjust the picture to become the background. The java script was used to make the buttons work. It was also used to create a random gerator for what the bot is going to pick. It was also used to tell you if you won or lost or if you typed sothimg in that you weren't supposed to.</p>
