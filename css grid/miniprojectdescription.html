        <p class="main">This page is a movie poster that I made. It is what I would imagine a movie poster for Call Of Duty would look like. This project was made using css and html. The html has all of the words. The css was used to change the image. It was also used to move everything to the proper place. I thought that the perfect person to be in the movie was Arnold Schwarzenegger. </p>
