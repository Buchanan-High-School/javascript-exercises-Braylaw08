        <p class="description">This class teaches you how to code using HTML, CSS, and Java Script. HTML is the simple things like adding words to the document and displaying them. The CSS is how you style the HTML and put thing in the places you want them. Lava Script is what you use to get informsation from other places and to get things to display in the HTML whne you click a button. I recommend that you take this class because if you do then you will be able to make your own website from scratch so everything can be the way that you want it to be. You can also make games using your knowledge about how it works. Some examples of thing you can make are a playable rock, paper, scissors, game, a dad joke generator, a store, a to-do list, ect.
